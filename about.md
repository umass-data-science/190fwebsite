This is a test change. This should be reflected in the site.

This is a local change. 

Data 8 is a "Foundations in Data Science" course taught for first year students
at UC Berkeley. It combines principles/skills in statistics, programming,
inference, modeling, hypothesis testing, visualization, and exploration.
In short, it provides a foundation in the many fields encompassed by
"data science", and gives students a practical introduction to the field.

This online resource is a template that you can use to fork and modify for
your own version of the Data 8 course. For instructions on how to do this,
and more information about Data 8 in general, see the
[Zero to Data 8](https://berkeleydsep.gitbook.io/zero-to-data-8/zero-to-data-8/)
guide.
