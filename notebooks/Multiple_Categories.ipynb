The ACLU listed several other reasons as well. Whatever the reasons, it seems clear that the composition of the jury panels was different from what we would have expected in a random sample from the distribution in the `Eligible` column."

    "We have developed a powerful technique that helps decide whether one distribution looks like a random sample from another. But data science is about more than techniques. In particular, data science always involves a thoughtful examination of how the data were gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eligible Jurors.** First, it is important to remember that not everyone is eligible to serve on a jury. On its [website](http://www.alameda.courts.ca.gov/pages.aspx/jury-duty-overview), the Superior Court of Alameda County says, \"You may be called to serve if you are 18 years old, a U.S. citizen and a resident of the county or district where summoned. You must be able to understand English, and be physically and mentally capable of serving. In addition, you must not have served as any kind of juror in the past 12 months, nor have been convicted of a felony.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Census doesn't maintain records of the populations in all these categories. Thus the ACLU had to obtain the demographics of eligible jurors in some other way. Here is their own description of the process they followed and some flaws that it might contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"For the purpose of determining the demographics of Alameda Countyâ€™s jury eligible population, we used a declaration that was prepared for the Alameda County trial of People v. Stuart Alexander in 2002. In the declaration, Professor Weeks, a demographer at San Diego State University, estimated the jury eligible population for Alameda County, using the 2000 Census data. To arrive at this estimate, Professor Weeks took into account the number of people who are not eligible for jury services because they do not speak English, are not citizens, are under 18, or have a felony conviction. Thus, his estimate should be an accurate assessment of who is actually eligible for jury service in Alameda County, much more so than simply reviewing the Census report of the race and ethnicity of all people living in Alameda County. It should be noted, however, that the Census data on which Professor Weeks relied is now ten years old and the demographics of the county may have changed by two or three percent in some categories.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the distribution of ethnicities of eligible jurors used in the analysis is itself an estimate and might be somewhat out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Panels.** In addition, panels aren't selected from the entire eligible population. The Superior Court of Alameda County says, \"The objective of the court is to provide an accurate cross-section of the county's population. The names of jurors are selected at random from everyone who is a registered voter and/or has a driver's license or identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this raises complex questions about how to accurately estimate the ethnic composition of eligible jurors in Alameda County. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear exactly how the 1453 panelists were classified into the different ethnic categories (the ACLU report says that \"attorneys ... cooperated in collecting jury pool data\"). There are serious social, cultural, and political factors that affect who gets classified or self-classifies into each ethnic category. We also don't know whether the definitions of those categories in the panels are the same as those used by Professor Weeks who in turn used Census categories in his estimation process. Thus there are also questions about the correspondence between the two distributions being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while we have a clear conclusion about the data in our table â€“ the panels do not look like a random sample from the distribution provided for eligible jurors â€“ questions about the nature of the data prevent us from concluding anything broader."
