Let's suppose that they plan to take a simple random sample of voters, though in reality their method of sampling would be more complex. How can they decide how large their sample should be, to get a desired level of accuracy?\n",

    "- The desired level of accuracy is that the width of the interval should be no more than 1%. That's pretty accurate! For example, the confidence interval (33.2%, 34%) would be fine but (33.2%, 35%) would not.\n",
